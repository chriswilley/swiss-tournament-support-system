# Swiss Tournament Support System

Using this tool you can manage your own ["swiss-system" tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) for activities like chess, Magic: The Gathering, Scrabble, or other games. Much easier than pencil and paper!

## Installation

For starters, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The program was written for Python 2.7, so that's what you should download and install. You may already have Python, especially if you're on a Mac or Linux machine. To check, open a Terminal window (on a Mac, use the Spotlight search and type in "Terminal"; on a PC go to Start > Run and type in "cmd") and type "python" at the prompt. You should get something that looks like this (run on my Mac):

```
Python 2.7.10 (v2.7.10:15c95b7d81dc, May 23 2015, 09:33:12)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Note the version number (2.7.10 in this case). If it starts with "3.", you should download version 2.7. If you have questions about any of this, check Python's [excellent online documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/).

The program also uses a Python module called [bleach](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach) to protect itself from hackers trying to mess with your friendly tournament. Bleach basically sanitizes text input so that your database won't get corrupted and you won't be hit with spam. After Python is installed you can install bleach by typing:

```
pip install bleach
```

in a Terminal window. If you have any issues, check out [their documentation](http://bleach.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

The program requires PostgreSQL as a database server, which you can [download here](http://www.postgresql.org/download/). PostgreSQL is an awesome (and free!) database server that's extremely powerful. There are also lots of tutorials and other articles about it all over the Web.

Finally, you'll need [git](http://git-scm.com/download) so that you can clone this project.


## Database setup

With PostgreSQL installed, you can easily setup the tournament database in a Terminal window. Just navigate to the folder that was created when you cloned the project, and type:

```
psql
```

This will put you in the PostgreSQL shell environment. Your prompt will look like this: '=>', and you'll see a message similar to:

```
psql (9.3.9)
Type "help" for help.
```

Now you can execute SQL commands and do all kinds of other neat stuff. But for now, just type:

```
\i tournament.sql
```

This will import the .sql file you cloned, which sets up the database completely. That was easy. To exit the PostgreSQL shell, just hit Ctrl-D.


## Testing the tournament functions

Once you have the project files and the database is set up, go to a command prompt and type:

```
python tournament_test.py
```

For now, this is the only interface to the program. All tests should pass.
